## 👨‍💻 **About me**

Hey, how's it going? I'm a Software Developer currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. I'm passionate about understanding how things are made, from the creation of the websites I visit to the technologies used to develop desktop applications.

Currently, I'm specializing in .NET and its fascinating language, C#.

## ☕  Are you working on any side projects right now?

In my **free time**, I enjoy playing FPS games, playing with my dogs, and I'm a coffee lover. Sometimes, I even like to create themes in VSCode just to keep them saved. A bit crazy, right?

## 🎤 What languages do you speak?

I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, my native language, and I consider myself to be at an intermediate level in English. I also have a strong desire to learn German.
