## 👨‍💻 **About me**

Hi there! My name is Denian (yes, that’s my real name, not a nickname inspired by the Debian distro). I’m a Software Developer currently studying Systems Analysis and Development.I’m passionate about the beauty of understanding how things are made, from the creation of the websites I visit to the technologies used in desktop applications.


- 🔭 Before entering the programming field, I worked as a video editor
- 🇧🇷 I'm from **Rosário do Ivaí**
- 🐶I have 3 pets: Lola, Pitico, and Luna.

## ☕ In my free time I like:

In my **free time**, I enjoy playing FPS games, playing with my dogs, and I'm a coffee lover. Sometimes, I even like to create themes in VSCode just to keep them saved. A bit crazy, right?

## 🎤 What languages do you speak?

I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, my native language, and I consider myself to be at an intermediate level in English. I also have a strong desire to learn German.
